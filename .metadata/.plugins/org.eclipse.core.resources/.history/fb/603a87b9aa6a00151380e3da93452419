/*
 * PrimitiveDataTypePractice.cpp
 * this is a memo for practicing primitive data types
 * what I learn at here is : how many different primitive data types,
 *                           in particular, bool, char, short int, long int, long double
 *                           and their memory size definition. a function we can use is sizeof()
 *                           in case of primitive data types, once declared, the memory will be automatically
 *                           allocated.
